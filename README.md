# What is this?
I absolutely hate making the same mistake twice. Across the many projects that I have worked on and will work on in the future, there is a significant amount of knowledge and lessons I learn that can make my next projects more efficient and successful. Many of these lessons become second nature and are integrated in the way I approach everything I do. Others, however, recur infrequently enough that I forget the next time it comes up. The cost of this is sometimes as small as having relocate a StackOverflow answer for fixing a git issue or as big as missing a deadline that I promised for a demo.

The goal of this style guide is to extend the idea of a coding standard guide to everything that I do. I want this to be a place where I document my solutions to mistakes that I have made in the past so that I have an easy-to-locate reference for how to avoid that in the future. This is very much a living document. I expect it to grow with new problems that come up, and expect my standards to evolve as I learn more. My hope is that documenting as much as I can will make my growth more effective.

I am also making this public in case anybody else finds use from these resources - it's better if other people don't make the same mistakes as I did :)
